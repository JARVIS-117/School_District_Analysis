## Overview Of School District Analysis

The school board has been notified of the nonethical adjustment of academic scores (math and reading) for students in the ninth grade attending Thomas High School. The school board has requested that an analysis be performed in the effort to uphold the testing standards for the state. The school board has requested to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact then perform an analysis on the school district. The objective is to compare this revised analysis of the district to the original analysis that was performed prior to the removal the scores (ninth grade) from Thomas High School.
